# ForgeRock Tube

ForgeRock Tube is a repository containing companion source-code for the videos published on my YouTube Channel @ [IAM jaTinder Singh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCncKTrfBUAlPjk0oKQ66rRg/).

# How to use this repo?

The source-code for each video is checked out and isolated through git branches. When you clone and checkout an individual branch, it will have a README with branch description and link to a video.
